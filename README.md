# 👋 Hi, I'm André Maccarini

### 📊 Data Science | 📚 Compliance | 💻 Tech Transition

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently transitioning from a solid legal background to the field of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, where I combine critical thinking, structured analysis, and programming to solve real-world problems.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🧠 Machine Learning applications using **Python, Scikit-learn and Pandas**
- 📈 Data visualization and storytelling using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit and others**
- 🏗️ Structuring data projects using best practices: modular code, notebooks, and reports
- 📊 Applying statistical analysis for **business insights and decision-making**
